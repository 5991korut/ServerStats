# How to setup ServerStats
Here is a step by step instruction, if you need more help after doing the steps you can join **[the support server here](https://discordapp.com/invite/vE8qKNV)**.
Make sure that the bot has **Manage Channels, Read Text Channels & See Voice Channels and Connect** permissions, but if you didn't change the invite link or settings on the invite page it should be good.

**Important** You can check if the bot has the right permissions by running the command `s/check`.

# How to customize the counters
## Custom the counter text:
You can change the counter text like normal just right click on the channel and click Edit Channel, keep in mind that there must be a number in the name (only the first number in the name will change).

## Disable or enable a counter:

You can disable counters by just **deleting the counter** or use the **s/counter delete** command, you can get them back by using **s/reset** or **s/counter create** (you can see a full list of all the counters with this command `s/counter`)

## Change to text channels:

You can also change the counter to a text channel (default is voice) just use this command **s/channel change**, keep in mind that there must be a number in the channel name.
