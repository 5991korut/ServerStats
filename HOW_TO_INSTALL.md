# How to setup ServerStats
Here is a step by step instructions, if you need more help after doing the steps you can add me on Discord **ZixeSea#1234** or join [**my discord server**](http://discord.animeglitch.net/).
Make sure that the bot has **administrator permissions**, but if you didn't change the invite link or settings on that page I will all be good.

# Step 1 (Adding the bot)
The first thing you have to do is add the bot to your server, use [**this link**](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=458276816071950337&scope=bot&permissions=8/) to add the bot. (You need to be login with Discord on your browser).

* Step 1: Click on the bar to show a list of server.
* Step 2: In the list click on your server or the server you want to add the bot too.
* Step 3: Click on the blue authorize button.
* Step 4: Do the "I'm not a robot" thing.

# Step 2 (Start the setup)
After you have added the bot you need to set it up.

* Step 1: Type in the chat: stats/start-setup (after the command you will get a message).

# Step 3 (Auto create channels)
My bot shows the member count in channel names, so the bot needs to create some channels.
**The channels will normally be placed at the bottom.**

* Step 1: Type in the chat: stats/create-channel (after the command you will get a message).
* Step 2: Check if the channels are created (If the channels don't display numbers like on the images above go to step 4).

# Step 4 (No number in the channels)
Only do this part if you think the numbers are incorrect or aren't displaying.

* Step 1: Type in the chat: stats/refresh (after the command you will get a message).

# Step 5 (Setup done)
After all the steps above your done and the bot will automatically change the numbers.

* Step 1: How amazing! you can also change the location of all the channels by click and holding the stats(serverstatsbot) section.

# You can also change the display text use this:
**It won't work if you change it the normal way (if someone joins it will change back).**

* To change the "All Members" text type: stats/set-all [text]
* To change the "Members" text type: stats/set-member [text]
* To change the "Bots" text type: stats/set-bot [text]
