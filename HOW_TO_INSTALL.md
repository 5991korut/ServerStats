# How to setup ServerStats V3
Here is a step by step instructions, if you need more help after doing the steps you can add me on Discord **ZixeSea#1234** or join [**my discord server**](https://discordapp.com/invite/bZt8WkS).
Make sure that the bot has **administrator permissions**, but if you didn't change the invite link or settings on that page I will all be good.

# Step 1 (Adding the bot)
The first thing you have to do is add the bot to your server, use [**this link**](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=458276816071950337&permissions=1068048&scope=bot) to add the bot. (You need to be login with Discord on your browser).

* Step 1: Click on the bar to show a list of server.
* Step 2: In the list click on your server or the server you want to add the bot too.
* Step 3: Click on the blue authorize button.
* Step 4: Do the "I'm not a robot" thing.

# Step 2 (Start the setup)
After you have added the bot you need to set it up or wait until someone joins or leaves.

* Auto: If you don't run the setup and the bot has the right permissions then the bot will automatically run the setup of someone joins or leaves.
* Step 1: Type in the chat: s/setup (after the command you will get a message if there is a error or if the bot is done).

# How to customize the counters:
**Custom the counter text**

You can just rename the channels the normal way (keep in mind that the number will be updated).
So if you change your channel name to:
- This are my members 0 = This are my members 5
- I have 100 bro = I have 5 bro
Don't set more than one number because the result will be something like this (4 of my 30 friends = 5 of my 5 friends)
**(The server has 5 members in this exemple)**

**Disable a counter**

You can also disable a counter if you don't want one of them, just delete the channel you don't want.
You can always get the channel back by using s/remake this will reset all the channel.
