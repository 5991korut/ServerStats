# How to setup ServerStats
Here is a step by step instructions, if you need more help after doing the steps you can join [**my discord server**](https://discordapp.com/invite/STZamSj).
Make sure that the bot has **Manage Channels, Read Text Channels & See Voice Channels and Connect permissions**, but if you didn't change the invite link or settings on that page I will all be good.

**Important** You can check if the bot has the right permissions by running the command `s/check`.

# Step 1 (Adding the bot)
The first thing you have to do is add the bot to your server, use [**this link**](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=458276816071950337&permissions=1133584&scope=bot) to add the bot. (You need to be login with Discord on your browser).

* Step 1: Type in the chat: **s/setup** or **@ServerStats setup** and then the channel type you want (**voice** or **text**) (after the command you will get a message if there is a error or if the bot is done).

# How to customize the counters
## Custom the counter text:
You can change the counter text like normal just right click on the channel and click Edit Channel, keep in mind that there must be a number in the name (only the first number in the name will change).

## Disable or enable a counter:

You can disable counters by just **deleting the counter** or use the **s/counter delete** command, you can get them back by using **s/reset** or **s/counter create** (you can see a full list of all the counter with this command `s/counter`)

## Change to text channels:

You can also change the counter to a text channel (default is voice) just use this command **s/channel change**, keep in mind that there must be a number in the channel name.
