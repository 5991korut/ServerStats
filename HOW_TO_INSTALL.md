# How to setup ServerStats
Here is a step by step instructions, if you need more help after doing the steps you can join [**my discord server**](https://discordapp.com/invite/bZt8WkS).
Make sure that the bot has **Manage Roles, Manage Channels, Read Text Channels & See Voice Channels and Connect permissions**, but if you didn't change the invite link or settings on that page I will all be good.

**Important** You can check if the bot has the right permissions by running the command `s/check`.

# Step 1 (Adding the bot)
The first thing you have to do is add the bot to your server, use [**this link**](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=458276816071950337&permissions=269503504&scope=bot) to add the bot. (You need to be login with Discord on your browser).

# How to customize the counters
## Custom the counter text:
You can change the counter text like normal just right click on the channel and click Edit Channel, keep in mind that there must be a number in the name (only the first number in the name will change).

## Disable or enable a counter:

You can disable counters by just deleting the counter or use the **s/counter &#60;counter&#62; off** command, you can get them back by using **s/remake** or **s/counter &#60;counter&#62; on**

## Change to text channels:

You can also change the counter to a text channel (default is voice) just use this command **s/channel &#60;counter&#62; &#60;ID/mention&#62;**, keep in mind that there must be a number in the channel name.
