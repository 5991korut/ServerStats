## How is it build?
ServerStats is built using JavaScript (Node.JS). The main module that the bot uses are [Eris V 0.12.0 (modified by ZixeSea)](https://github.com/ZixeSea/eris) and [Eris-Sharder: V 1.9.0 (modified by ZixeSea)](https://github.com/ZixeSea/eris-sharder), the bot is also using some other module like: Axios V 0.19.2, Mongoose V 5.9.4 and Express V 4.17.1.

At the time the bot itself and all code related to it is closed source, this means you can't access it in any way.
The reason for this is to make it difficult if not impossible to make clones/copies of the bot or code (copies could be used in malicious ways).

---

## Database and data (MongoDB)
Of courese the bot needs the save some data and the bot only save data he really needs (the exist out of server and channel ids).
You can also see all that that has been save about your server by using `s/data`, this sends an exect export of your servers collection of data.

You can also easily delete the data by kicking or banning the bot or running the command `s/reset` (this means that after this you can't get your data back even if you kick the bot by accident).

Also the database is hosted locally and there aren't any ways to access them from outside the host server (and only ZixeSea can access the server).
