>***NOTE:*** Here is a list of bots that are related to this project (any other bot is fake or a scam), always make sure you use an invite link from a trusted source.

### Additional info
* ServerStats is made with the idea to make it free, so you will see a lot of things that are free in this bot but paid in other comparable bots (like changing the counter text).
* **ServerStats requires some permissions**, If you don't give the bot the right permissions it won't work (you can check it by using `s/check`).
* ServerStats is trusted by more then **1 million different** servers.
* ServerStats is also accepted on multiple bot list websites, here are some examples: **[top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/458276816071950337)**, **[discord.bots.gg](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/458276816071950337)**, **[discord.boats](https://discord.boats/bot/458276816071950337)**, **[bots.ondiscord.xyz](https://bots.ondiscord.xyz/bots/458276816071950337)** and **[botsfordiscord.com](https://botsfordiscord.com/bot/458276816071950337)**.

## How is it build?
ServerStats is built using JavaScript (Node.JS). The main modules that the bot uses are Eris (modified) and Eris-Sharder (modified), the bot is also using some other modules like: Axios and Mongoose.

At the time the bot itself and all code related to it is closed source, this means you can't access it in any way.
The reason for this is to make it difficult if not impossible to make clones/copies of the bot or code (copies could be used in malicious ways).

---

## Database and data (MongoDB)
Of course the bot needs the save some data but it only save data he really needs (this includes server and channel ids).
You can also see all that has been saved about your server by using `s/data`, this sends an exact export of your servers collection of data.

You can also easily delete the data by kicking or banning the bot or running the command `s/reset` (this means that after this you can't get your data back even if you kick the bot by accident).

Only the devs can access the server where the database is running on so that means that only the devs can have full access to the complete database.
