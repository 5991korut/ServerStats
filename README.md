## How is it build?

ServerStats is built on node.js using Visual Studio Code. I'm using the NPM module [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).

## Main function

The main function in my bot is the name changer for the channels, with this function the bot can display how much users there are in your server.
This function is based on the .setName function in discord.js [Click here for the documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/VoiceChannel?scrollTo=setName).

## Saved data (FireStore)

Of courese the bot needs the save some data and the only data the bot needs is 3 channel IDs.
The bot is made with the [**AVG law**](https://www.amsadvocaten.com/blog/intellectual-property-law-in-the-netherlands/are-you-ready-for-the-new-general-data-protection-regulation-avg/) in mind, that means that I only save data if i need to and won't save personal data.
Also if you delete my bot all saved data from your server will be deleted.
